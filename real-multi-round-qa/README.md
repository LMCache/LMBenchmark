# Real Multi-Round QA Benchmark

## Overview

This benchmark is designed to identify **the maximum number of user sessions ($C\times S$) that can be kept active while maintaining a steady-state TTFT ≤ 2 s (95-th percentile)**. By sweeping the concurrency (C) and sequential (S) independently, it isolates whether compute capacity or KV-cache pressure is the first limiting factor.

We highly recommend monitoring vLLM/LMCache/GPU/storage metrics at the same time.

This benchmark feeds full‑length novels to your LLM server and asks many follow‑up questions, just like a book critic. It is handy for testing long‑context handling and KV‑cache tools such as LMCache.

## Two simple knobs

| Option | What it means |
| ---- | ---- |
| `--num-users-concurrent` (C) | How many threads run in parallel.  |
| `--num-users-sequential` (S) | How many users each thread serves in turn. |

You can:
* raise concurrent to test compute-side capability (higher GPU utilization; total KV footprint also rises).
* raise sequential to test KV-cache pressure (larger resident KV per GPU, little change in instantaneous GPU utilization).

## Execution model

```
Concurrent USER: {A,B}
Sequential USER: {X,Y}
All USER: {AX,AY,BX,BY}

## Getting Started

```bash
# download the novels in the gutenberg dir.
python prepare.py --output data --model Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-1M # Models used in the benchmark
```

```bash
# Run the benchmark many times
BASE_URL="http://localhost:8000/v1"
MODEL="Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-1M"
NUM_ROUNDS=3
OUTPUT_DIR="bench_dir"
SRC_DIR="./data/128k"
mkdir -p "$OUTPUT_DIR"

for c in {1..4}; do # You can change c and s to any value you like.
  for s in {1..4}; do
    TIMESTAMP=$(date +%s)
    OUTPUT_FILE="${OUTPUT_DIR}/bench_c${c}_s${s}_${TIMESTAMP}.json"
    echo "Running benchmark: concurrent=${c}, sequential=${s}"
    python bench.py --num-users-concurrent "$c" --num-users-sequential "$s" --num-rounds "$NUM_ROUNDS" --model "$MODEL" --base-url "$BASE_URL" --output "$OUTPUT_FILE" --src-dir "$SRC_DIR"
  done
done

```

LMCache allows 1.3x increase in the number of user sessions kept active at least.

Note: LMCache has not yet reached its limit in this case,
so we can aim to further improve the score by changing C and S.
